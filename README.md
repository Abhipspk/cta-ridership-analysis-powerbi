## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) wants to better understand ridership patterns across their Bus and Rail systems. By analyzing usage over time, day types, and service lines, the CTA can improve service scheduling, marketing efforts, and operational planning.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Cleaned raw CSV using Python (pandas)
   - Removed nulls, converted date columns, added calculated metrics (`Total Rides`, `Day Type`, etc.)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified trends based on day type, month, and year
   - Compared Bus vs. Rail ridership

3. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**  
   - Built multiple visuals: Line chart, Bar charts, Pie chart, Card metrics, Slicers

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visuals & Insights

### 1. ðŸ“‰ **Ridership Over Time (Line Chart)**
- Displays total daily ridership over the years
- Clearly shows a steep decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and gradual recovery

### 2. ðŸ“Š **Average Ridership by Day Type (Bar Chart)**
- Weekdays have significantly higher ridership than weekends
- Useful for adjusting service levels by day

### 3. ðŸ“… **Monthly Ridership Trends (Bar Chart)**
- Shows seasonality: higher ridership in summer, lower in winter
- Useful for promotional or marketing timing

### 4. ðŸ§® **Card Metrics**
- **Total Ridership**
- **Average Daily Ridership**
- **Average Weekday Ridership**

### 5. ðŸ§© **Year Filter (Slicer)**
- Allows dynamic filtering by year using `service_date`

### 6. ðŸ¥§ **Bus vs. Rail Ridership (Pie Chart)**
- **Bus:** 65.6% of total ridership  
- **Rail:** 34.4% of total ridership  
- Suggests bus is the dominant transport mode in CTA

## âœ… Actionable Recommendations

- ðŸšŒ **Increase bus frequency** during weekday peak hours due to higher demand.
- ðŸ“£ **Promote weekend rides** through discounts or events to increase off-peak ridership.
- ðŸ“Š **Monitor long-term ridership trends** post-COVID to optimize resource allocation.
